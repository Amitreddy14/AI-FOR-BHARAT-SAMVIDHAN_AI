**Empowering 400 million Indians to claim their constitutional rights through AI-powered voice assistance**

</div>

## Overview

SamvidhanAI is a voice-first AI platform that democratizes access to government welfare schemes for India's 400M+ marginalized citizens. The system addresses the critical problem of ₹1.3 lakh crore in unclaimed welfare funds by providing an accessible, multi-language interface that guides users through scheme discovery, application, and tracking.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Voice-First**: All interactions prioritize voice over text, with voice as the primary interface
2. **Offline-Resilient**: System degrades gracefully to SMS/USSD when internet is unavailable
3. **Privacy-Preserving**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data, federated learning for AI improvements
4. **Accessibility-Focused**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, works with assistive technologies
5. **Scalable**: Horizontally scalable microservices architecture supporting millions of users
6. **Government-Integrated**: Direct integration with DigiLocker, UMANG, Aadhaar eKYC

### System Context

The platform serves four primary user personas:
- **Illiterate domestic workers**: Feature phone, 2G connectivity, regional dialect speakers
- **Tribal farmers**: Basic smartphone, intermittent 3G, distrust of officials
- **Persons with disabilities**: Smartphone with screen reader, accessibility requirements
- **NGO field workers**: Manage 50+ families, need bulk operations and dashboards
